## 📋 Complete Setup Guide

**Need detailed instructions?** Follow these step-by-step guides to get all required credentials and configure your bot.

### 1. Discord Bot Setup

#### Step 1: Create a Discord Application

1. Visit [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **"New Application"** button (top right)
3. Enter a name for your bot (e.g., "Strava Running Bot")
4. Click **"Create"**

#### Step 2: Create and Configure the Bot

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Bot"**
2. Click **"Add Bot"** (if not already created)
3. Under **"Token"** section:
   - Click **"Copy"** to get your bot token
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Keep this token secret! It gives full access to your bot
   - Paste this token in your `.env` file as `DISCORD_TOKEN`

#### Step 3: Configure Bot Permissions

1. Still in the Bot section, scroll down to **"Privileged Gateway Intents"**
2. Enable **"Message Content Intent"** (required for some features)

#### Step 4: Generate Bot Invite Link

1. In the left sidebar, click **"OAuth2"** → **"URL Generator"**
2. Under **"Scopes"**, select:
   - ✅ `bot`
   - ✅ `applications.commands`
3. Under **"Bot Permissions"**, select:
   - ✅ `Send Messages`
   - ✅ `Use Slash Commands`
   - ✅ `Embed Links`
   - ✅ `Attach Files`
   - ✅ `Read Message History`
   - ✅ `Use External Emojis`
4. Copy the generated URL at the bottom

#### Step 5: Add Bot to Your Server

1. Open the invite link in your browser
2. Select your Discord server from the dropdown
3. Click **"Authorize"**
4. Complete the CAPTCHA if prompted

#### Step 6: Get Channel ID

1. In Discord, go to **User Settings** (gear icon ⚙️)
2. Go to **"Advanced"** and enable **"Developer Mode"**
3. Navigate to the channel where you want the bot to post activities
4. Right-click on the channel name
5. Select **"Copy Channel ID"**
6. Paste this ID in your `.env` file as `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`

### 2. Strava API Setup

#### Step 1: Create Strava API Application

1. Go to [Strava API Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Log in with your Strava account (create one if you don't have it)
3. Click **"Create App"** button

#### Step 2: Fill Application Details

1. **Application Name**: Enter your bot name (e.g., "Strava Running Bot")
2. **Category**: Select **"Other"**
3. **Club**: Leave blank (unless you have a specific Strava club)
4. **Website**: Enter your website URL or GitHub repository URL
5. **Application Description**: Brief description of your bot
6. **Authorization Callback Domain**:
   - For **development**: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
   - For **production**: Your actual domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Don't include `http://` or `https://`, just the domain

#### Step 3: Get API Credentials

1. After creating the app, you'll see your application details
2. Copy the **"Client ID"** and paste it in your `.env` file as `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`
3. Copy the **"Client Secret"** and paste it in your `.env` file as `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`
4. **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Keep the Client Secret confidential!

#### Step 4: Generate Webhook Verification Token

1. Generate a secure random token for webhook verification:

   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex'))"
   ```

2. Copy the generated token to your `.env` file as `STRAVA_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`
3. This token ensures that webhook requests are actually coming from Strava

#### Step 5: Note Your Rate Limits

- Strava API has rate limits: **100 requests per 15 minutes**, **1000 requests per day**
- The bot automatically handles these limits with a 20%/10% safety margin and proper throttling

### 3. Environment Configuration

#### Setup Your Environment File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit your `.env` file with the credentials obtained from the previous steps. The `.env.example` file contains detailed comments for each variable.

#### Generate Required Keys

```bash
# Generate encryption key (required)
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Generate webhook verification token (if not done already)
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex'))"
```

> **⚠️ Security**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Keep all tokens and keys secure.

### 4. Webhook Setup (Production Only)

**⚠️ Note**: Webhooks are only needed for production deployment. For development, you can test the bot without webhooks.

#### Prerequisites for Webhook Setup

- A **public domain** or server accessible from the internet
- **HTTPS enabled** (Strava requires HTTPS for webhooks)
- Your bot running on that server

#### Step 1: Verify Your Server is Accessible

1. Deploy your bot to your production server
2. Ensure it's running on a public domain with HTTPS
3. Test that `https://yourdomain.com/health` returns a health check response

#### Step 2: Create Webhook Subscription

```bash
# Create webhook subscription (replace with your actual domain)
node utils/setup.js create-webhook https://yourdomain.com/webhook/strava

# This will register your server to receive activity updates from Strava
```

#### Step 3: Verify Webhook Setup

```bash
# List existing webhooks to confirm creation
node utils/setup.js list-webhooks

# You should see your webhook listed with the callback URL
```

#### Step 4: Test Webhook (Optional)

1. Post a new activity on Strava (or use an existing member's activity)
2. Check your bot's logs to see if the webhook is received
3. Verify the activity appears in your Discord channel

#### Webhook Management Commands

```bash
# List all webhook subscriptions
node utils/setup.js list-webhooks

# Delete a specific webhook (get ID from list command)
node utils/setup.js delete-webhook SUBSCRIPTION_ID

# Validate webhook configuration
node utils/setup.js validate-webhook
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Bot Not Responding

```bash
# Check bot status
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# View logs
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f

# Verify Discord permissions
# Check bot invite URL and server permissions
```

#### Member Registration Failing

```bash
# Verify Strava credentials
node utils/setup.js validate

# Check redirect URI configuration
# Ensure domain matches Strava app settings
```

#### Activities Not Posting

```bash
# Check webhook subscription
node utils/setup.js list-webhooks

# Verify member tokens
curl http://localhost:3000/members

# Check webhook logs
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f | grep webhook
```

#### Token Refresh Errors

```bash
# Check member status
curl http://localhost:3000/members

# Manually refresh if needed
# Members may need to re-authorize
```

#### Webhooks

- **403 Forbidden**: Check that your `STRAVA_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` matches
- **404 Not Found**: Verify your server is running and accessible
- **SSL Certificate Error**: Ensure your domain has valid HTTPS
- **No webhook events**: Check Strava API rate limits and webhook subscription status

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in your `.env` file.

### Support

For additional support:

1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all configuration settings
3. Test individual components (Discord, Strava, webhooks)
4. Review Strava API quota and rate limits
5. Check network connectivity and firewall settings
